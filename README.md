# PEP-Python-DailyPractice

Day 1 – Python Basics (PEP Classes)

On Day 1, I practiced and understood the fundamentals of Python programming, covering core concepts through hands-on examples and small problems.

🔹 Topics Covered

Printing output and basic syntax (Hello World)

Type conversion (int, float) and checking data types

Conditional statements (if, elif, else)

Age eligibility check

Even/Odd number check

Grading system

Traffic light logic

Loops

for loop (numbers, odd numbers, patterns)

while loop (multiplication tables, number reversal)

Functions

Normal functions

Returning values

Reusability of code

Lambda functions

Addition, square, and cube of a number

User input handling and problem solving

Lists

Accessing, adding, removing, sorting, and basic operations

Tuples

Indexing, slicing, count, and index methods

Sets

Unique elements, add/update/remove

Set operations (union, intersection, subset, superset)

Day 2 – Python Core Concepts Practice

On Day 2, I practiced and implemented multiple Python core concepts with hands-on examples and mini projects to strengthen my fundamentals.

🔹 Topics Covered
📌 Dictionaries

Creating and accessing dictionaries

Using dictionary methods:

keys(), values(), items()

get(), update(), copy()

pop(), popitem(), clear()

Adding, updating, deleting key–value pairs

Dictionary length and merging dictionaries

📌 Mini Projects using Dictionaries

Contact Book Application

Add new contacts

View saved contacts

Search contacts

Delete contacts

Student Record Management System

Add student details

View all student records

Search student by roll number

Delete student records

📌 String Manipulation

String indexing and slicing

String methods:

lower(), upper(), strip(), replace()

find(), split(), count()

startswith(), endswith()

Character frequency counting

Replacing vowels in a string

Reversing strings and words

📌 Two Pointer Technique

Traversing strings using start and end pointers

Palindrome checking using:

String slicing

Two-pointer approach

📌 File Handling

Creating, reading, writing, and appending files

Reading files using read(), readline(), and readlines()

Counting characters and words in a file

Modifying file content using replace()

Working with multiple text files

Using with statement for safe file handling

📌 Exception Handling

Handling runtime errors using try, except, and finally

Handling file-related exceptions (FileNotFoundError)

Preventing program crashes due to invalid input or missing files

Day 3 – Practice Session (Python & Basics of DSA)
🔹 Python Collections

Created and iterated over lists

Added elements using append()

Calculated sum of list elements

Reversed a list using slicing

Removed duplicates from a list

Accessed elements from a tuple

Converted:

List ↔ Tuple

Tuple → List

List → Set

Dictionary → Set (keys only)

Set → Dictionary using fromkeys()

🔹 Exception Handling

Learned different types of exceptions:

ZeroDivisionError

ValueError

TypeError

IndexError

KeyError

FileNotFoundError

Used:

try-except

Multiple except blocks

else block

finally block

Manually raised exceptions using raise

Created custom exception (LowBalanceError)

📌 Understood that finally always executes and can override return values.

🔹 Python Behavior & Concepts

Mutable vs Immutable objects

Integers → immutable

Lists → mutable

Tuple modification using reassignment

Set automatically removes duplicates

Boolean arithmetic (True + True)

String operations (+, *)

for-else and while loop behavior

🔹 Important Python Tricky Outputs

finally block overrides return

Nested try-except-finally execution order

Exception re-raising using raise

🔹 Problem Solving & DSA Basics

Move all zeros to the end of an array

Palindrome check using two-pointer approach

Find the longest word in a sentence

Subarray sum count (brute force)

Two Sum problem

Brute force approach

Optimized two-pointer approach

Fast & Slow Pointer (Tortoise and Hare) technique

Used to find the middle element of a list
